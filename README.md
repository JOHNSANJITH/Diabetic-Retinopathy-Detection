# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
This project uses a deep learning model to classify retinal images into different stages of diabetic retinopathy. It aims to assist early detection and diagnosis using automated techniques.

Model Overview
Model: CNN (e.g., ResNet50, VGG16, or custom architecture)

Framework: TensorFlow / Keras / PyTorch

Classes: No DR, Mild, Moderate, Severe, Proliferative DR

Dataset
Dataset used: [APTOS 2019 / Kaggle DR Dataset / Other]

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanlikesmath/diabetic-retinopathy-resized

Images were preprocessed (resized, normalized, augmented)

Features
Image preprocessing and augmentation

Training and validation split

Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and AUC

Model saving and loading

Future Work
Integration with a web app

More explainability (e.g., Grad-CAM)

Deploy model as API
